# ros2-project

The package builds and runs correctly and includes a working implementation of motion logic and colour detection using OpenCV. All three RGB boxes are detected and highlighted in the camera feed. The robot performs exploration and reacts to detected boxes as intended.

Due to technical instability (Gazebo rendering, zombie processes) and time constraints, I was unable to finalize the logic for approaching the blue box within 1 meter. However, the detection logic and preliminary navigation sequences are included and have been tested.
